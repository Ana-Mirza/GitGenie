# GitGenie
Tool that allows users to generate commit histories in the form of a specific word or phrase.

## Initial setup (or fix missed commit)

In case you missed a commit or want to start the commit history from the beginning of the week instead of the middle:

1. Commit your git:

```$  git commit -m "Add relevant message"```

2. Change time or date of your latest commit:

```$ git commit --amend```

3. Edit date, save and push to remote

```$ git push -f```
