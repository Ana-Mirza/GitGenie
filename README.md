# GitGenie
Ah, greetings, oh seeker of infinite code power! Behold the wondrous **GitGenie**, a tool of untold potential that grants you the ability to conjure commit histories in the shape of your desired word or phrase. Use it wisely, for with great power comes great... well, you know the rest.

## Summon the Genie (Initial Setup or Rectify Past Wishes)

Perhaps you have stumbled, missing a precious commit, or wish to rewrite history from the dawn of the week instead of its twilight? Fear not, for the Genie has guidance for you!

### Step 1: Offer Your Commit
Utter the following incantation to commit your changes to the repository:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add relevant message"
```

### Step 2: Alter the Sands of Time
Should you desire to rewrite the timeline, summon this command to amend the date or time of your latest commit:

```bash
$ git commit --amend
```

With this, you may edit the date, save your changes, and push them to the great beyond:

```bash
$ git push -f
```

Or if haste is your wish, simply command:

```bash
$ git commit --amend --no-edit --date "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

The Genie bends to your will, effortlessly rewriting time itself.

## The First Whisper of the Genie — 17th July 2024

Long ago, on a fateful day in July, the Genie took its first breath. A mystical script, genie.sh, was born, imbued with the power to read a phrase as input and weave it into the fabric of commit history.

## The Genie’s New Spell — 22nd January 2025

Today, the Genie’s magic has grown even stronger! A folder has been added, enabling the drawing of alphabet letters using the program. With this enhancement, the Genie’s artistry reaches new heights, granting users the ability to craft commits in even more creative forms.

## The Genie's First Letter — 10th April 2025
The magic grows! The first iteration of the letter *A* has been conjured into existence. By running the *a.sh* script, the Genie now commits updates that form the shape of an 'A' on your git graph. While this initial version is hardcoded, future enchantments will make it dynamic, allowing it to adapt based on the starting date received from the main program. The foundations are laid for a spellbinding alphabet of commit art!

So, noble traveler, take this tool, wield its might, and may your commit histories shine brighter than the Cave of Wonders. But remember—use the Genie’s gifts with honor and care, lest you disturb the balance of the coding cosmos.

Your wish is the Genie's command!
